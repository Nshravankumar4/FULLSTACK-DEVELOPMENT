Perfect! Let’s design a **complete project plan** that covers **all the skills from the job description**, gives you a **professional repository structure**, and sets you on a **clear learning roadmap**.

---

## **Project Overview**

### **Project Name:** **WinConnect**

### **Tagline:** *“A Modern Windows App for Secure BLE & Wi-Fi Device Communication with Async Networking and Protocol Buffers”*

### **Goal:**

Build a **Windows desktop application** that can **discover devices on a local network**, connect via **Wi-Fi Direct or BLE**, communicate **securely using HTTPS/TLS**, and serialize data with **Protocol Buffers**. The UI will use **WinUI 3** with async operations for smooth performance.

## **Learning Roadmap (Step-by-Step)**

### **Month 1 – C++ & Windows App Basics**

* Modern C++ (smart pointers, STL, async)
* WinRT basics & COM concepts
* WinUI 3: build simple app with a window, buttons, and list view
* Simple “Hello World” BLE or Wi-Fi Direct scan app

---

### **Month 2 – Networking & BLE**

* HTTPS/TLS networking with WinHTTP / C++ REST SDK
* IPv6 basics
* BLE communication: GATT read/write, L2CAP channels
* mDNS service discovery on Windows

---

### **Month 3 – Advanced App & Async Programming**

* Async patterns: co_await, IAsyncOperation
* Protocol Buffers: define messages, serialize/deserialize
* Integrate BLE + Wi-Fi networking + protobuf
* Debugging with WinDbg and traffic analysis with Wireshark
* Unit testing with Catch2 / Google Test

---

### **Month 4 – Integration & Portfolio Ready**

* Integrate backend services with frontend WinUI 3
* Real-time device discovery and secure messaging demo
* Add logging, error handling, and performance monitoring
* Polish UI and UX
* Prepare **README + demo video** for GitHub
